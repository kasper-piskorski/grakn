/**
 * This class is bound per-keyspace, and shared between sessions on the same keyspace just like the JanusGraph object.
 * The general method of operation is as a cache, into which the statistics delta is merged on commit.
 * At this point we also write the statistics to JanusGraph, writing recorded values as vertex properties on the schema
 * concepts.
 *
 * On cache miss, we read from JanusGraph schema vertices, which only have the INSTANCE_COUNT property if the
 * count is non-zero or has been non-zero in the past. No such property means instance count is 0.
 *
 * We also store the total count of all concepts the same was as any other schema concept, but on the `Thing` meta
 * concept. Note that this is different from the other instance counts as it DOES include counts of all subtypes. The
 * other counts on user-defined schema concepts are for for that concrete type only
